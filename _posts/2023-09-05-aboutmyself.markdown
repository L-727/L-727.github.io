### current status
I am a student majoring in computer science at FZU. In the past three years, I have learned some basic knowledge such as C,C++, Py, algorithm and so on in school, but obviously I still need to learn them more deeply. I am interested in computer vision, deep learning and other knowledge, and I would like to learn related content through various channels.

### Some work in progress
In the middle of 2023, some friends and I applied for the school-level srtp project "Research on the Quality Identification System of the Golden Lotus Based on Machine Vision".(《基于机器视觉的金线莲质量鉴别系统研究》)

### Hobbies and Interests

I like delicious food,travel and playing various board games with my friends, but at the same time, my outgoing personality encourages me to do sports,Even though I'm on the thin side, I'm still trying to gain weight by working out and eating extra, and I think one day I'll have the perfect bmi

### Future planning

I will try my best to prepare for the entrance exam. If I have the honor to go to the shore, I will continue to study computer knowledge in the postgraduate stage. If I fail to do so, perhaps my second choice is to find a job
